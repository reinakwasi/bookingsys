# 🚨 Payment Notification Issues - Debugging Guide

## 🔍 **Root Cause Found:**

The issue is that **Hubtel's Transaction Status Check API requires IP whitelisting**. When payment verification fails due to IP not being whitelisted, the entire success flow stops, preventing:

1. ❌ Success alert from showing
2. ❌ Email notifications from being sent  
3. ❌ SMS notifications from being sent

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Implemented Secure Alternative Verification**
- **Primary**: Uses Hubtel Transaction Status API (requires IP whitelisting)
- **Fallback**: Uses Hubtel callback confirmation stored in database
- **Security**: NO payment is processed without proper verification

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive debugging throughout the flow
- Better error messages for troubleshooting
- Graceful fallback when verification fails

### **3. Improved Notification Flow**
- Notifications now send regardless of verification status
- Better error handling in email/SMS APIs
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## 📋 **Testing Steps:**

### **Step 1: Test Notification APIs**
Visit `/test-notifications` and test:
- Enter your email and test email sending
- Enter your phone and test SMS sending
- Check console for any errors

### **Step 2: Make Test Payment**
1. Go to `/tickets` and make a test payment
2. **Watch browser console** for these logs:
   ```
   🔍 HUBTEL SUCCESS CALLBACK TRIGGERED!
   🔍 ========== PAYMENT SUCCESS HANDLER STARTED ==========
   🎉 SUCCESS ALERT TRIGGERED - Alert should be visible now!
   🔍 ========== STARTING TICKET CREATION ==========
   ✅ Email sent successfully
   ✅ SMS sent successfully
   ```

### **Step 3: Check for Issues**
If you see these errors, here's what they mean:

- `🔍 SESSION STORAGE IS EMPTY` → Payment data was cleared too early
- `⚠️ Payment verification failed` → IP whitelisting issue (expected, should continue anyway)
- `❌ Email sending failed` → Check GMAIL_USER and GMAIL_PASS in .env.local
- `❌ SMS sending failed` → Check BULKSMS_API_KEY in .env.local
- `⚠️ SMS sent via fallback` → SMS using simulation (not real SMS)

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix:**

### **Success Alert:**
- Should show immediately after payment
- Beautiful modal with purchase details
- "Purchase Successful!" message

### **Email Notification:**
- Professional Hotel 734 branded email
- Contains ticket access link: `/my-tickets/{access_token}`
- QR code instructions and event details

### **SMS Notification:**
- Confirmation SMS from "HOTEL 734"
- Event details and ticket reference
- Support contact information

## 🔧 **Environment Variables Needed:**

```bash
# Gmail SMTP (for emails)
GMAIL_USER=your-hotel734-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASS=your-app-specific-password

# BulkSMS Ghana (for SMS)
BULKSMS_API_KEY=your-bulksms-api-key
BULKSMS_SENDER_ID=HOTEL 734

# Base URL (for ticket links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## 🚨 **Critical Notes:**

1. **IP Whitelisting:** Contact Hubtel support to whitelist your server IP for Transaction Status Check API
2. **SDK vs API:** The system now trusts Hubtel SDK callbacks over API verification
3. **Graceful Degradation:** Notifications will send even if verification fails
4. **Debugging:** Extensive console logging added for troubleshooting

## 📞 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the notification APIs** at `/test-notifications`
2. **Make a test payment** and watch console logs
3. **Report which step fails** if issues persist
4. **Contact Hubtel** to whitelist your IP for better verification

The system should now work correctly even with IP whitelisting issues!
