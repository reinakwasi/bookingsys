## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Key Differences from Paystack:**

| Aspect | Paystack (Old) | Hubtel (New) |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **User Experience** | Popup/Modal | Iframe/Modal (Onsite Checkout) |
| **Amount Format** | Multiply by 100 | Use as-is (50.00) |
| **Reference Length** | Any length | Max 32 characters |
| **Payment Methods** | Card, Mobile Money | Card, Mobile Money, Wallet, GhQR |
| **Currency** | GHS, NGN, etc. | GHS only (Ghana) |
| **Integration** | JavaScript SDK | REST API + Iframe |

## 💰 Supported Payment Methods

Hubtel supports all major Ghanaian payment options:

- ✅ **MTN Mobile Money**
- ✅ **Vodafone Cash**
- ✅ **AirtelTigo Money**
- ✅ **Bank Cards** (Visa, Mastercard)
- ✅ **Hubtel Wallet**
- ✅ **G-Money**
- ✅ **Zeepay**
- ✅ **GhQR** (Ghana QR Code)

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### **Already Implemented:**
- ✅ HTTP Basic Authentication with Base64 encoding
- ✅ Server-side payment initialization (API keys never exposed)
- ✅ Payment verification before ticket creation
- ✅ Unique transaction references (prevents duplicates)
- ✅ Session storage for pending payments
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

### **Best Practices:**
- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Server-side API calls only
- ✅ Payment verification mandatory
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Graceful error handling

---

## 📊 Transaction Status Check

**Important Note:** Hubtel's Transaction Status Check API requires IP whitelisting.

### **What This Means:**
- The `/api/payments/verify` endpoint checks payment status
- Hubtel only allows requests from whitelisted IP addresses
- Without whitelisting, you'll get 403 Forbidden errors

### **How to Fix:**
1. Find your server's public IP address
2. Contact Hubtel support: support@hubtel.com
3. Request to whitelist your IP for Transaction Status Check API
4. Provide your merchant account number

### **Alternative:**
- Use Hubtel's callback URL (webhook) for payment notifications
- Callback URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/hubtel/callback`
- Hubtel will POST payment status to this URL
