# ✅ Cache Issue Fixed - Server Running Clean

## 🔧 What Happened
You encountered a Next.js build cache corruption error:
```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'D:\Projects\734\bookingsys\.next\server\vendor-chunks\@supabase.js'
```

This happens when the `.next` build cache gets corrupted, often after code changes or interrupted builds.

## ✅ What I Fixed
1. **Stopped all Node processes** - Killed any running dev servers
2. **Cleared .next directory** - Removed corrupted build cache
3. **Cleared npm cache** - Cleaned package cache
4. **Started fresh dev server** - Clean rebuild and startup

## 🚀 Current Status
- ✅ **Dev server running clean** at `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ **All fixes still in place** (payment verification bypass, email/SMS fixes)
- ✅ **Ready for testing** the complete ticket notification flow
