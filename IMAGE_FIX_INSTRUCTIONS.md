# Image Fix Instructions

## Issue
The uploaded image "BIG NIGHT SMOKE" shows "$ GHC100" which has a redundant dollar sign that needs to be removed.

## Required Fix
The image should show only "GHC100" without the dollar sign ($).

## How to Fix
1. Open the uploaded image in any image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.)
2. Locate the text that shows "$ GHC100"
3. Remove or edit out the dollar sign ($) so it shows only "GHC100"
4. Save the corrected image
5. Replace the original image file with the corrected version

## Alternative Solution
If you cannot edit the image directly, you can:
1. Create a new version of the image without the dollar sign
2. Update any references to the image filename in the codebase if needed

## Current Status
- ✅ Room prices updated to 350, 300, 250 GHC
- ✅ Room inventory updated (Royal Suite: 1, Superior Room: 7, Classic Room: 5)  
- ✅ Currency changed from USD to GHC throughout the system
- ✅ Admin dashboard updated with new prices and inventory
- ⏳ Image dollar sign removal (requires manual image editing)

The system is now fully updated with the correct pricing and inventory. Only the image needs manual editing to remove the dollar sign.
