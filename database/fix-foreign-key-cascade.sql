-- Fix foreign key constraint to allow CASCADE deletion
-- This will allow tickets to be deleted even if they have payment records

-- First, let's check the current foreign key constraint
SELECT 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name,
    tc.constraint_name,
    rc.delete_rule
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
      AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
      AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.referential_constraints AS rc
      ON tc.constraint_name = rc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
  AND tc.table_name = 'payments'
  AND kcu.column_name = 'ticket_id';

-- Drop the existing foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE payments 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS payments_ticket_id_fkey;

-- Recreate the foreign key constraint with CASCADE delete
ALTER TABLE payments 
ADD CONSTRAINT payments_ticket_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (ticket_id) 
REFERENCES tickets(id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Verify the new constraint
SELECT 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name,
    tc.constraint_name,
    rc.delete_rule
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
      AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
      AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.referential_constraints AS rc
      ON tc.constraint_name = rc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
  AND tc.table_name = 'payments'
  AND kcu.column_name = 'ticket_id';

-- Now you should be able to delete tickets and their related payments will be automatically deleted
