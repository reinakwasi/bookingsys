# ✅ Hubtel SDK Integration - READY TO TEST!

## 🎉 What's Done

I've successfully integrated **Hubtel's official JavaScript SDK** using their Modal Integration method. This is the proper, official way to accept payments with Hubtel.

## 📦 Package Installed

```bash
npm install @hubteljs/checkout
```

## 🔧 How It Works Now

### **1. User clicks "Pay Now"**
- Form data is collected
- Payment initializes via `/api/payments/initialize`

### **2. API Returns Configuration**
- `checkoutUrl` - Hubtel checkout URL
- `checkoutDirectUrl` - Direct checkout URL
- `basicAuth` - Encoded credentials for SDK
- `merchantAccount` - Your merchant account number
- `clientReference` - Unique payment reference

### **3. SDK Opens Modal**
```javascript
checkout.openModal({
  purchaseInfo: {
    amount: 100,
    purchaseDescription: "BIG NIGHT SMOKE - 1 ticket(s)",
    customerPhoneNumber: "233200552491",
    clientReference: "TKTc6566f42_1237846858_wisbeg"
  },
  config: {
    branding: "enabled",
    callbackUrl: "https://yoursite.com/api/payments/hubtel/callback",
    merchantAccount: 2032060,
    basicAuth: "base64encodedcredentials"
  },
  callBacks: {
    onPaymentSuccess: (data) => {
      // Payment successful!
      // Close modal and show success
    },
    onPaymentFailure: (data) => {
      // Payment failed
      // Show error message
    }
  }
});
```

### **4. Payment Completes**
- `onPaymentSuccess` callback fires
- Modal closes automatically
- Success message appears
- Ticket purchase is created

## 🚀 Test It Now!

### **Step 1: Make Sure Environment Variables Are Set**

**In Production (Vercel/Netlify/etc.)**:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBTEL_API_ID=Y7Z4W6W
HUBTEL_API_KEY=b95ff74e757d46bab24ae0db95067015
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBTEL_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=2032060
```

**CRITICAL**: Make sure these are set in your deployment platform!

### **Step 2: Test Payment**
1. Go to your live site
2. Click on a ticket
3. Click "Purchase Ticket"
4. Fill in customer details
5. Click "Pay Now"

### **Step 3: What You Should See**

**✅ Success Flow**:
1. Toast: "Loading payment options..."
2. **Hubtel modal opens** with payment options
3. Toast: "Payment page loaded. Select your payment method."
4. User selects payment method (Mobile Money, Card, etc.)
5. User completes payment
6. Toast: "Payment successful! Processing your ticket..."
7. **Modal closes automatically**
8. Success alert appears with ticket details

**❌ If It Doesn't Work**:
Check browser console for errors and send me the error message!

## 🔍 Debugging

### **Check Console Logs**:
```
🚀 Opening Hubtel checkout using official SDK (Modal Integration)
📋 Payment reference: TKTc6566f42_1237846858_wisbeg
📤 Opening Hubtel modal with: { amount, description, phone, reference }
✅ Hubtel checkout initialized
✅ Hubtel checkout loaded
✅ Payment succeeded: { ... }
✅ Hubtel modal opened successfully
```

### **Common Issues**:

**1. "Hubtel configuration missing"**
- **Cause**: Environment variables not set in production
- **Fix**: Add all three environment variables to your deployment platform

**2. "Payment configuration missing from API response"**
- **Cause**: API not returning basicAuth or merchantAccount
- **Fix**: Check API logs, ensure environment variables are set

**3. Modal doesn't open**
- **Cause**: SDK not loaded or JavaScript error
- **Fix**: Check browser console for errors

**4. "Invalid credentials"**
- **Cause**: Wrong API ID or API Key
- **Fix**: Verify credentials in Hubtel dashboard

## 📋 Environment Variables Checklist

### **Required in Production**:
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBTEL_API_ID` - Your Hubtel API ID
- [ ] `HUBTEL_API_KEY` - Your Hubtel API Key (server-side only)
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBTEL_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` - Your merchant account number

### **How to Set in Vercel**:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Click "Environment Variables"
3. Add each variable with its value
4. Redeploy your application

### **How to Set in Netlify**:
1. Go to Site settings → Build & deploy
2. Click "Environment variables"
3. Add each variable
4. Trigger new deploy
