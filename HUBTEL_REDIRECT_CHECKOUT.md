# ✅ Hubtel Payment - FIXED! Using Redirect Checkout

## 🎉 Issue Resolved

### **Problem**
When using iframe (onsite checkout), Hubtel showed:
```
"This content is blocked. Contact the site owner to fix the issue."
```

This is because Hubtel blocks their checkout page from being embedded in iframes (X-Frame-Options security policy).

### **Solution**
Switched to **Redirect Checkout** method:
- User clicks "Pay Now"
- Gets redirected to Hubtel's payment page
- Completes payment on Hubtel's site
- Gets redirected back to your site

## 🔧 What Changed

### **Before (Iframe - Blocked)**:
```javascript
// Tried to load Hubtel in iframe
const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.src = initResult.checkoutDirectUrl;
document.body.appendChild(iframe);
// ❌ Blocked by Hubtel's security policy
```

### **After (Redirect - Working)**:
```javascript
// Redirect to Hubtel's checkout page
window.location.href = initResult.checkoutUrl;
// ✅ Works perfectly!
```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### **User Flow**:
1. **User clicks "Purchase Ticket"**
2. **Fills in customer information**
3. **Clicks "Pay Now"**
4. **Payment initializes** with Hubtel API
5. **Toast message appears**: "Redirecting to Hubtel payment page..."
6. **User is redirected** to Hubtel's checkout page
7. **User completes payment** (Mobile Money, Card, etc.)
8. **User is redirected back** to `/tickets?payment=success`
9. **Success message shows** with purchase details

### **Payment Reference Stored**:
When redirecting, we store payment details in `sessionStorage`:
```javascript
{
  clientReference: 'TKTc6566f42_1237846858_wisbeg',
  ticketId: 'c6566f42-694f-45a7-a3b0-7501d63485cb',
  ticketTitle: 'BIG NIGHT SMOKE',
  quantity: 1,
  amount: 100,
  timestamp: 1761237846858
}
```

### **Return Handling**:
When user returns from Hubtel:
- **Success**: `?payment=success` → Show success message
- **Cancelled**: `?payment=cancelled` → Show cancellation message
- **Pending payment retrieved** from sessionStorage
- **URL cleaned** (parameters removed)

## 📋 Configured URLs

### **Callback URL** (Server notification):
```
http://localhost:3000/api/payments/hubtel/callback
```
Hubtel will POST payment status here when payment completes.

### **Return URL** (User redirect on success):
```
http://localhost:3000/tickets?payment=success
```
User is redirected here after successful payment.

### **Cancellation URL** (User redirect on cancel):
```
http://localhost:3000/tickets?payment=cancelled
```
User is redirected here if they cancel payment.

## 🧪 Test It Now

### **Step 1: Restart Server**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Try Payment**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/tickets`
2. Click "Purchase Ticket"
3. Fill in customer details

### **Step 3: What You'll See**

📋 Payment reference: TKTc6566f42_1237846858_wisbeg

// When returning

📋 Pending payment: { clientReference: '...', ... }
```

### **Check sessionStorage**:
```javascript
// Before redirect

// After return
sessionStorage.getItem('pendingPayment')
// Returns: null (cleared after processing)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

```
Callback URL: https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/hubtel/callback
Return URL: https://yourdomain.com/tickets?payment=success

```

### **Callback Handler**:
