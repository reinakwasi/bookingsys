# âœ… Fixed: Duplicate Email/SMS Issue

## Problem Identified
Customers were receiving **duplicate emails and SMS** after ticket purchase because notifications were being sent from TWO places:

1. **`database.ts`** - `ticketPurchasesAPI.create()` sends email/SMS
2. **`tickets/page.tsx`** - After calling `ticketPurchasesAPI.create()`, it sent email/SMS AGAIN

This caused every ticket purchase to send **2 emails and 2 SMS messages**.

## âœ… Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Notifications from `tickets/page.tsx`
- Removed the duplicate email/SMS sending code (lines 370-424)
- Added comment explaining notifications are handled in `database.ts`
- Removed unused imports (`emailAPI`, `smsAPI`, `emailTemplates`, `smsTemplates`)

### 2. Enhanced Email Template in `send-ticket-email/route.ts`
- Updated to use professional Hotel 734 branding (gold/navy colors)
- Added complete ticket purchase details:
  - Event name and date
  - Quantity purchased
  - Total amount paid (GHS)
  - Payment reference number
  - Purchase date/time
- Matches the style of booking confirmation emails

### 3. Updated `database.ts` to Pass Complete Data
- Now passes all ticket purchase details to email API:
  - `ticket_title`, `quantity`, `total_amount`
  - `payment_reference`, `event_date`, `purchase_date`
- Ensures professional email with all necessary information

## How It Works Now

### Single Notification Flow:
```
1. User completes Paystack payment âœ…
2. tickets/page.tsx calls ticketPurchasesAPI.create() 
3. database.ts creates ticket purchase in Supabase
4. database.ts automatically sends:
   - Professional email with ticket details ðŸ“§
   - SMS with ticket confirmation ðŸ“±
5. User receives ONE email and ONE SMS âœ…
```

## Email Content Now Includes:
- ðŸŽ« Event name and date
- ðŸ“Š Quantity and total amount (GHS)
- ðŸ”¢ Payment reference number
- ðŸ“… Purchase date/time
- ðŸ”— Link to view/download tickets

- ðŸ“ž Hotel 734 contact information

## SMS Content Includes:
- Event name and date

- Reference number
- Link to view tickets
- Hotel 734 contact info

## Result:
- âœ… **No more duplicate emails** - only ONE email sent
- âœ… **No more duplicate SMS** - only ONE SMS sent
- âœ… **Professional branding** - matches Hotel 734 style
- âœ… **Complete information** - all purchase details included
- âœ… **Cleaner code** - removed redundant notification calls

## Files Modified:
1. `/app/tickets/page.tsx` - Removed duplicate notification code
2. `/lib/database.ts` - Enhanced data passed to email API
3. `/app/api/send-ticket-email/route.ts` - Professional email template
